        back in 2020 Dell Colombia was struggling with customers information
        their employees were writing in their database, delivers where taken to
        wrong addresses or even shipped to places that did not exist in
        Colombia. This issue cost money, time, and customers' loyalty to the
        company. That is why my brother who is Outbound Fulfillments and
        logistics senior at Dell asked me to find a solution using technology
        that could fit the organization. With this in mind, I started research
        on address validation, as it is hard to use Colombia´s address database
        and it is not completely open source we started to explore Google cloud
        services. With this project I practiced Html, CSS, JavaScript, and
        modern technologies implementation with google Apis, eventually we
        deployed the platform that scaled to Mexico and Perú.
